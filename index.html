                  Melbourne, FL Interior and Exterior Home Painting. No project too big or too small. Jeff Wilson Painting has been serving Brevard County since 2008. Jeff Wilson painted for over 30 years starting in Massachusetts where his work would cary from small 1 bedroom repaints, to painting historical buildings around foxborough, to flipping houses in the Western MA area. He moved Melbourne, FL in 2008 where he started Jeff Wilson Painting LLC and worked very hard to make life easier for his family. He passed away in 2016 and the business is now run by his son Justin, who worked with him from 18-26. Painting Contractor licenses are no longer issued in Brevard County, but Jeff Wilson Painting LLC is a fully insured registered business.
